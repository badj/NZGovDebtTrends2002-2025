### Features of the Interactive Graph

**Interactive Graph for New Zealand Government Debt Trends from 2002-2025 with metrics-supported features:**


- **Scale Toggle Dropdown:**
  - A dropdown to switch between "Linear Scale" (default) and "Log Scale" for the right y-axis (Debt Amount, Per Capita, Population).
  - This affects only the secondary y-axis to handle the wide range of values (e.g., Debt Amount: 35–185B NZD, Per Capita: 8900–34300 NZD, Population: 3.9–5.4M).


- **Data Table graph views and dropdowns:**
  - The table is interactive and syncs with the chart’s filters (e.g., PM or Party filters adjust the table rows).
  - **Metrics Dropdown:** Toggle "All Metrics", "% GDP Only", "Amount Only", "Per Capita Only", "Population Only".
  - **Party Filter Dropdown:** Filter by "All Parties", "Labour Only", "National Only" (applies to debt metrics, not population).
  - **PM Filter Dropdown:** Filter by "All PMs", "Helen Clark", "John Key", "Bill English", "Jacinda Ardern", "Christopher Luxon".
  - **Population Colour Toggle Dropdown:** Options for "Green (Default)", "Orange", "Purple", "Hide Population".

  
- **Export Options:** "Export PNG" and "Export CSV" for downloading the graph image or data.
  - Buttons for the "Export Options" to toggle between a data table export (below the chart), exporting all columns (Year, Debt % GDP, Debt Amount, Per Capita, Prime Minister, Ruling Political Party, Population Count).
  - PNG: Downloads a high-resolution image (1200x750) via the "Export PNG" option.
  - CSV: Downloads a file (nz_government_debt_data.csv) with all table data.


- **Range Slider:** Zoom into specific year ranges (2002–2025).


- **Full hover tooltips:** All columns
  - Year
  - Debt % GDP
  - Amount
  - Per Capita
  - PM
  - Party
  - Population in millions


- **Party-based colouring:**
  - blue=Labour
  - red=National
  - for debt metrics, population in a separate colour.


- **PM change annotations:** Indicating PM change over.


- **The chart has four traces:** 
  - 0: % GDP
  - 1: Amount
  - 2: Per Capita
  - 3: Population in millions

### Playwright automated end-to-end tests

- **Automated end-to-end testing has been integrated for the interactive visualisation using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as the test framework:**
   - The end-to-end tests verify the page and graph features, including dropdown filters, chart rendering, export options, and interactive controls.
   - [Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) was used with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Claude Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) and [Chat-GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) as agents for the prompts to [generate tests](.github/1-generate-tests.prompt.md) and for [fixing failing tests](.github/2-fix-failing-tests.prompt.md).


 - Playwright Key Test Coverage *(25 Tests)*:
   - Visualisation loads and displays correctly.
   - All dropdowns contain expected filter options.
   - Selecting filters updates the graph as expected for plotting and page chart content.
   - Export buttons (PNG, CSV) trigger downloads.
   - Mode bar and chart controls are present and functional.
   - Table Data and Data Sources are present and functional.

### Run tests and generate the test run report to view the test results

**Test run with Playwright HTML report generation**

1. Execute the test (headless)
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```
2. OR Execute the test (headed / browser opens)
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --headed
   ``` 
3. OR Execute the test with the UI
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --ui
   ```
4. OR Execute the test (headless) with increased workers to speed up the test run
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --workers=10
   ``` 
5. View the HTML report when test execution completes: ```show-report``` command prints to the terminal
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```
- Terminal output sample of a successful test run
  ```terminaloutput
  NZGovDebtTrends2002-2025 (main) % npx playwright test --workers=10
  
  Running 25 tests using 10 workers
  25 passed (9.2s)

### Playwright MCP integration with Claude Sonnet and Chat-GPT agents

> - Usage of [Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) to generate a Playwright project that explores your site, write your Tests, and iterate until all tests pass.
> - Playwright MCP in Agent Mode can autonomously navigate your app, discover key functionality, and generate runnable tests — *in some cases, no manual scripting required.*
> - [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was set to use [Claude Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) and [Chat-GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) as agents in Agent mode.

[_⇡ Return to the Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)

---

### Configurations to enable Playwright MCP:

1. Configure the MCP Playwright server to run locally inside the  [IDE project folder](.idea/mcp.json) in a file called ```mcp.json``` *([IntelliJ IDEA / Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) was used for this project)*

   ```JSON
   {
     "servers": {
       "playwright": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. In the project IDE folder [an autoApprove settings file was added](.idea/settings.json) called ```settings.json```

- By adding this code, no 'click to continue' is required each time, allowing the agent to continue on its own.

  ```JSON
  {
  "chat.tools.autoApprove": true
  }
  ```

3. Prepare test prompts and add the prompt Markdown to the ```.github``` folder

- For this project, the prompt Markdown file: [1-generate-tests](.github/1-generate-tests.prompt.md) was used to create the initial Playwright tests.
- For this project, a second prompt Markdown file: [2-fix-failing-tests](.github/2-fix-failing-tests.prompt.md) was used to continue fixing and updating generated Playwright tests further.

4. In the IDE, use Agent Mode, add the prompt to the context to create the initial tests and iterate until all tests pass.

- Agent mode uses the Playwright MCP to navigate to the site and uses the browser to explore the website like a real user.
- Prompts instruct the agent to navigate, discover functionality, and then generate tests automatically based on its interactions.
- The initial / first prompt used for Playwright MCP to start autonomously: 

   ```terminaloutput
   Explore https://badj.github.io/NZGovDebtTrends2002-2025/
   ```

- This generated the bulk of the tests, allowing me to tweak it further to my preferences and expectations.
- After wrapping up the interactions, the agent summarises its findings and can continue to update and fix the tests if required.

5. Test Generation & Execution:
  
> The agent generates a full Playwright test file based on the interactions, and it fixes errors automatically before running each iteration of the tests.

- Once generated, it opens a terminal and runs the tests. When it passes, you can / should inspect the steps taken to confirm accuracy and check for false positives. 
- It’s a full cycle where Playwright MCP: explores → generates the tests → executes the tests → reviews the results of the test run. 
- **For best results:** Iterate and refine the prompts to increase the test coverage and prompt the agent to explore additional areas as well.

### Notes and observations during Playwright MCP agent usage

>- Approximately 70% of the tests were created and fixed smoothly with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) set to use [Claude Sonnet 3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) and [Chat-GPT 4.1](https://chatgpt.com/) as agents using [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).
>- Manual effort to fix and refactor some of the failing and passing tests was necessary where the MCP agent missed the mark!
